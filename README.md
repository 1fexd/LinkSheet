# LinkSheet

A Material3 replacement for [OpenLinkWith](https://github.com/tasomaniac/OpenLinkWith)

## What does this do?

This replaces the url-app-chooser that was removed in Android 12.

For this app to work properly, you must disable "Open supported links" in "App Info" -> "Open by
default" for every official app which has verified links you intend to use it for.
